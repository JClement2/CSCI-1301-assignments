Algorithm
Step 1: Import scanner

Step 2: set class and main lines

Step 3: Declare our values. in this case using doubles so we can have our grad broken down into a decimal

Step 4: Create a new scanner object (in this case named "scan1")

Step 5: Now we create multiple propts to the user to input values for assignments/quizzes/tests.

Step 6: Once we have all of our inputs from the user, we then set up 3 more doubles.
Each one will add the respective categories together then divide them by the amount of 
assignments/quizzes/tests given.

Step 7: At this point, we take the totals of assignments/quizzes/tests and then multiply them 
by their weights, that being 30%/20%/50% respectively.

Step 8: Now that our grades are properly weighted out, we take the 3 numbers from our "weighing"
and add them together to get the Overall Grade Average.

   // something you may have noticed at the point, assuming you put in the values from the example,

   // i ran this multiple times checking the lines of code each time, but i cant tell that anything is different.
   // The only thing i can guess is that perhaps when this screenshot was taken the grade weights may have been different
   // at that time. Or, it's possible the combonations of doubles/integers were used and i simply cannot figure it out.
   // At this point, this iteration of code is the closest i have gotten to the answer in the example so we are going with that.
