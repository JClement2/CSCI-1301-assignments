Algorithm For Assignment #2

Step 1: Import Scanner
Step 2: Create Class and Main Method
Step 3: Type out a short introductory message stating what game we are playing and notifying the players of the different inputs availabe.
Step 4: Set up a String for input validation at the end of the program cycle.
Step 5: Speaking of cycles, set up the do-while cycle so that all further code may be captured in a loop to be executed at least once.
        (Note: All code from here on out, with the exception of the GAME OVER message will take place inside of the do-while.) 
Step 6: Set a prompt for player 1 to input a number from 1 to 5, and then set a scanner to capture input. Also set up a while loop so that should Player 1 
        enter a number other than those requested the program will display an error message and reprompt the user.
Step 7: Repeat Step 6 but change player 1 inputs for player 2.
Step 8: Ok now comes the fun part, with our P! and P2 prompts set, we now set a multitude of if-else-if statements to account for every combination of numbers,
        As well as make both Player 1 and Player 2 variants.
Step 9: With our if-else-if statements done, all thats left now is input validation. For this, i set up another scanner to caprute that input and set the program
        to output a short Yes/No quastion regarding repeat plays. We can also use that String from earlier rrepeat the entire program should the correct answer
        (in this case "Yes" or "Y") be entered in. Otherwise it will end the session and move on to the final message.
Step 10: Set a final message declaring "GAME OVER" should the user decide to stop playing the game.
